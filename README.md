Hello World Project - First-ever Repository!

Hello, GitHub Community!

I am Ian, a network professional working as a Senior Network Engineer for a global provider of software, services, consulting and outsourcing solutions. I look forward on mingling with the community here to help me develop my Python scripts (and soon, Ansible) for network automation. I have just started learning Python.

Outside being a network professional, I am a photographer, guitarist, and an audiophile. I love anime, too! :)

Cheers!
